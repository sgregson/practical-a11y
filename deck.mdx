### `Usability`

<Text>
  <code>
    The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve
    specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a
    specified context of use.
  </code>
</Text>

  Software Engineering specification <strong>ISO 9241-11</strong>

  </a>
</Caption>

```notes
Usability is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object such as a tool or device.

Accessibility is Usability applied to our users with disabilities - so generally we're just going to talk about Usability, because Accessibility is Usability for All

Chances are you already had a good / loose idea what accessibility was. Those of us who talk about Accessibility a lot dwell on the importance of humanizing the process.

### `What you probably want to know`

**How does this impact me?**

**How does this impact my audience?**

**What do I need to learn?**

---

**How does this impact me?**

- Requirements vary by client and audience
- You're going to have to learn some stuff

<Appear>we'll get there</Appear>

---

**How does this impact my audience?**

- Your audience just got bigger
- Start thinking a bit bigger about behavior

---

**What do I need to learn?**

- The aim here is creating an improved experience
- "Compliance" doesn't mean you're done
- I'm going to go through what I think are the most common and highest impact "gotchas" in Accessibility.

# #2 How do I do this?

First test for impact.

---

If you've never tested your site before, usually the most direct way is to point an auditor at it.

There are a lot of them out there. Choosing comes down to confidence in the results and providing actionable content.

My personal favorite two are `aXe` and `pa11y` - they're

There are a lot of tools out there which help

# #3 How do I keep it that way?

So the big question is "I've solved it, how do I keep it that way?"

Because it's the worst thing to find out that you've worked on a

# #4 Conclusions / Take-aways

> _Hopefully the take-away from this is "wow, this is all pretty straightforward"_

1. A11y is all about usability and making sure your app reaches the largest audience it can
2. The **WCAG document** is your guide to getting accessibility right
   1. **Level AA is the best practice**
   2. The Acceptance Criteria give nuanced explanations for all issues you will find
3. There are a LOT of tools to help analyze the state of your code and site
   1. **Build time** (static analysis) - eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y,
   2. **Runtime** (library-dependent) -
   3. **DOM-parsing** (URL/DOM â†’ results)- aXe, pa11y, pa11y-ci

# DRAFT CONTENT (pull above the fold)

Like I said in the abstract of this talk, I have three assumptions:

1. Know nothing (but are hopefully a fast learner)

   > This is new content for a lot of people! Even if you don't know anything about this "Accessibility" thing â€“ there will be no assumptions of prior experience.

2. Have Questions

   > Building accessible sites can be tough - we'll dig into the details of how to test and evaluate how usable your site is and how to prevent regressions.

3. Want to Learn

   > How accessibility will impact their site / business - Web Accessibility guidelines are the same for all sites but don't affect every site equally. We'll talk about sites which have tackled this topic well, those who tackled it poorly, and who benefits from tackling this early (hint: everyone!).
